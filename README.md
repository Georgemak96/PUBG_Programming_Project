# PUBG_Programming_Project
This is a coding project implemented as part of the module 'Computer Programming', Department of Methodology, LSE. The aim of the project is to develop some modules with the necessary functions, which are used to analyze the social contagion of cheating in the online game PUBG. The hypotheses being tested are the following: 

1. Cheaters tend to team up with other cheaters more than chance.
2. Players who observe cheaters are likely to become cheaters more than chance.
3. Players who are killed by cheaters are likely to become cheaters more than chance.

The 'Implementation.ipynb' loads the modules and calls their functions to address the aforementioned hypotheses.
